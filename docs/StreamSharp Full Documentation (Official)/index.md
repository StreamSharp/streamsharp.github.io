# Full Documentation

This section will contain all documentation regarding StreamSharp and its feature set. However, only the official helper plugins will be documented here alongside the base documentation. Third party helper plugin providers are expected to provide their own documentation. We also plan for our documentation to be available (at least partially) in IDEs via the pop-ups that appear in software such as Visual Studio to guide you on how to use our tool.

## Important notice

Please note that StreamSharp is originally based on [BarRaider's StreamDeck-Tools](https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-tools/)
