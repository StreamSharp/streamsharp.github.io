## What is StreamSharp?
StreamSharp is a new C# wrapper being designed for developing StreamDeck plugins. It has a focus on modularity and flexibility. You can choose as lean or as full a system as you like, and it can easily be expanded with "helper plugins" that expand the functionality beyond the base. As the wrapper develops, functionality will be documented on this site. Helper plugins that I personally make will also be documented on this site.
