# Welcome to StreamSharp

## What is StreamSharp?
StreamSharp is a new C# wrapper being designed for developing Stream Deck plugins. It has a focus on modularity and flexibility. You can choose as lean or as full a system as you like, and it can easily be expanded with "helper plugins" that expand the functionality beyond the base. As the wrapper develops, functionality will be documented on this site. Helper plugins that we personally make will also be documented on this site.

## Difficulty of transferring
If you are currently using BarRaider's StreamDeck-Tools, then StreamSharp should be a relatively seamless transfer. StreamSharp uses StreamDeck-Tools as a baseline for the wrapper. However, there may be a small learning curve in getting familiar with the modularity of StreamSharp. If you use any other wrapper, you will have to double check the functionality.

## Beginning with StreamSharp
Due to the nature of software development, difficulty in using StreamSharp will depend on a multitude of factors. We offer a getting started guide to try and help ease the process.
