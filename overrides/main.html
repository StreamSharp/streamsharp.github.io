  <p>Hi there, this documentation is a work in progress for a product that has yet to be built. The documentation thus is somewhat boilerplate, and it will be retweaked as required during the product development lifecycle. Thanks for understanding!</p>
  <!--
  Note to self: Remember to add the following to mkdocs.yml once the product is ready
  theme:
  features:
    - announce.dismiss
